# Dynamic Trees

Dynamic Trees is a visual and graphical mod for The Long Dark. 

It aims to add a bit more realism and immersion to the game by making the textures of the trees more dynamic, changing from bare green to partially covered to fully white as snow accumulates.

* Custom tree textures that change colour of foliage over time, starting from coniferous green to the solid white we're used to.
* Dynamic snow accumulation calculation in real time based on current weather and wind. Light and heavy snow will increase accumulation, amplified by winds. Clear & non-snowy weather will decrease snow build on trees, provided there is sufficient wind.
  
Textures will change on scene load as well as whenever each accumulation threshold is hit. They are designed to be gradual steps up as to not be too jarring.
